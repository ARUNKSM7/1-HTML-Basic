            <center><h3>Gate Way of INDIA</h3></center>

            <center> <img src="3.jpg" alt="no image" height="300px" width="600px"border="3px"</center>
            <Center><p> The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India.<br>
                 It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, <br>
                 in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.

                The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, <br>
                inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument <br>
                by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924.<br>
                 The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural<br>
                  resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

            <center> <img src="4.jpg" alt="no image" height="300px" width="600px"border="3px"</center>
            <Center><p> The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal.<br>
                Commissioned in 1943, the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, <br>
                because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta).<br>
                On 14 June 1965, it was renamed Rabindra Setu after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian<br>
                 and Asian Nobel laureate. It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.
